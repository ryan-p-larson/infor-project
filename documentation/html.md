# HTML
-----

Possible HTML templates for our content management system. We would like to create a set of generalized templates so that while orgs may have unique layouts and styles, the navigation of the site is uniform.

- Main page (index)
   * Jumping point to individual orgs and login pages
- ???About Page (for content management system). Page that has contact info, information, etc etc
- Orginization home page
   * Add/edit pages
   * Calendar & events
   * Orginization settings
- Content (Individual and granular)
   * Consider this the 'leaves' of the CMS tree
   * Content could be put up for events that span orgs/are published by the CMS as well
   * Several types of content could be put in; articles, announcements, forms, etc..
- Pagination (for orgs *and* org's content pages)
- User settings
